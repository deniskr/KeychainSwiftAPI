# KeychainSwiftAPI

This Keychain Swift API library is a wrapper of iOS C Keychain Framework.
It allows easily and securely storing sensitive data in secure keychain store
in Swift projects. Interfacing with the original C keychain API is combersome from
Swift, and is prone to errors which lead to security vulnerabilities. This
library is written according to the best security coding practices and guidelines.

## Usage

Import the KeychainSwiftAPI
```swift
import KeychainSwiftAPI
```

Create a query object:
```swift	
let q = Keychain.Query()
```

Populate the query object with data. Query properties correspond to attribute keys of the C Keychain API, 
protery values correspond to attribute values of the C Keychain API. 

```swift
q.kSecClass = Keychain.Query.KSecClassValue.kSecClassGenericPassword
q.kSecAttrDescription = "A password from my website"
q.kSecAttrGeneric = "VerySecurePassword".dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding, allowLossyConversion: false)
q.kSecAttrAccount = "admin"
q.kSecReturnData = true
q.kSecReturnAttributes = true
q.kSecReturnRef = true
q.kSecReturnPersistentRef = true
```

Call Keychain.secItemAdd, which returns a pair of success code and result object. 

```
let r = Keychain.secItemAdd(query: q)
```

Success code is wrapped in Keychain.ResultCode enum for convenience.

```
if (r.status == Keychain.ResultCode.errSecSuccess) {
    println("Password saved. Returned object: \(r.result)")
} else {
    println("Error saving password: \(r.status.description)")
}
```

r.result contains the object that was retured by the C SecItemAdd underlying function call.


## Requirements

iOS 8.0 or above
You have to use cocoapod compiled from the Swift branch, since the master branch of cocoapods still does not fully support Swift. 
See: [Using CocoaPods Unreleased Features](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/unreleased-features)

## Installation

KeychainSwiftAPI is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "KeychainSwiftAPI"
```
